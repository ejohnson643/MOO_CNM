	This file contains utility functions for reading and checking EA runfiles.

	For example, we will want to have a function that verifies that all the
	entries in a runfile are legal and that any folders/files/functions exist 
	and are functional.  We will also have a function that loads the runfile
	from a json to a dictionary.
